# Tests

## 001 No masks

- Just getting up to speed with my own scripts again

## 002 Masks

- Same as above, but using Anna's masks

## 003-006 Ghosts

- Trying the ghost prompt (with masks) at different strengths
- Now running on all frames of seance1

## 007-008 Candles

- All frames of seance1 with the candle prompt using 2 different seeds

## 009 Mask Painting

- Using the mask pasting code I wrote for Alice to paste in the first image
- It reduces flickering but doesn't solve it
- The masks are different so we still get a lot of variation frame to frame
- Also right now in some frames we're pasting in parts of people's heads/bodies from the first frame

## 010 Seed Interp Attempt

- I photoshopped several frames together to get a people-free background image
- But seed interpolation doesn't seem to work with img2img

## 011 Seed Search for Ghost Prompt

- need to look more closely
- but probably will change anyway with masks and such
- 104 is interesting

## 012 Seed Search for Ghost Prompt

- haven't looked yet

## 013 txt2img Seed Interpolation

- Proving that seed interpolation does still work for txt2img
