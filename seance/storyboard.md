Who is she / whose face I cannot see / little velvet bed / little leather case / who has come / to take her place?

- who knows, just play around with other small edits

## Scene 4

white flowers heavy heart gauze dressed what are you holding?

- change the feather into flowers

## Scene 5

"Whose hand is holding the flowers?" and I'm glad we thanked the hardworking atoms

there's a cut before this one, when it comes in the mirror is already fully the image

- this one is really short
- add an extra few arms/hands on the table, or the candles etc.

- add sections of blue brick to the walls

the constant clergy...
